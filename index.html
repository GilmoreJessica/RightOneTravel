          <p>Navarre, a compact beach community found just east of Pensacola at

            pristine white shoreline.

          <p>Nestled between Gulf Islands National
            Seashore and Navarre Beach Marine Park, this beach community offers
            solitude and simplicity.
          </p>

         <p>Its pristine beaches are named among the
            best in the nation year after year, and visitors compare crossing
            Navarre Bridge to transcending paradise time and time again.
